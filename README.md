# IR Receiver Module

#### Project Overview

The IR Receiver Module project demonstrates how to use an IR receiver with an Arduino Mega to decode and interpret signals from an IR remote control. This project reads the signals from the IR remote and prints the received code to the Serial Monitor. It also includes a function to handle specific IR codes and perform custom actions based on the received signals.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **IR Receiver Module**
- **IR Remote Control**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the IR Receiver to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin** of the IR receiver module to digital pin 2 (`irReceiverPin`) on Arduino Mega
   - **VCC** of the IR receiver module to **5V** on Arduino Mega
   - **GND** of the IR receiver module to **GND** on Arduino Mega

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the IR receiver module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Library Installation:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries`.
   - Search for `IRremote` and install the library by `shirriff`.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Point your IR remote at the IR receiver and press buttons.
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for the received IR codes and corresponding messages.

#### Applications

- **Remote Control Systems:** Use in projects requiring remote control functionality.
- **Home Automation:** Integrate into home automation systems to control devices using an IR remote.
- **Learning Projects:** Great for learning how IR communication works and how to handle IR signals in microcontroller projects.

#### Notes

- Replace the IR codes in the `handleIRCode` function with the actual codes from your IR remote. You can find these codes by observing the Serial Monitor when you press the buttons on your remote.
- Add more cases in the `handleIRCode` function to handle additional buttons from your remote control.
- Ensure the IR receiver is positioned correctly to receive signals from the remote control effectively.
